# :weight_lifting: A Workout Tracker With Swift :spiral_notepad:

### Background :anchor:
For the past few years, strength training became one of my favourite hobbies. I find myself going to the gym almost everyday and I learned tracking my sessions is important to make progress.

### Issue :exclamation:
I started tracking my workouts by creating a few tables in my Notes app, then plan and record my exercises each day. However, this quickly became impractical as the the tables' rows and columns grew too large to fit on my phone's screen.

### Solution :brain:
I came up with the idea while testing and learning Swift. At the time, I wanted to gain experience in mobile development and felt this project was a perfect opportunity. 

I understand there are numerous existing exercise tracking apps, many with much more advanced features, but I wanted one specifically tailored for my workout routine.

### Implementation :pick:

I built this app entirely with Swift. SwiftUI is used for the UI framework and is implemented following MVVM architecture. CoreData is used to manage and store the data.

Currently, this app is not published on the AppStore as I do not want to pay Apple 99 dollars. :money_with_wings:
